A Standard Neural network will confused during training for an inverse model as the it tries to map the target performance directly to the parameters (geometry in our case), and hence it receives a conflicting training signals. So it will see same input paired with multiple corret datasets and get confused.

In a Tandem Network the Forward model acts as a physics predictor whihc maps the model to its performance. This is freezed and then the inverse model generated the design parameters from the target performance.

The output of the inverse neural net is fed to the pre-trained forward net. Then, the loss is calculated from comparing the forward neural net's predicted performacnce against the original target performance. So when the validation prodices correct physical responce the neural net will give that specific geometry irrespective of any specific values.

Forward neural net is pre-trained and weights are frozen ---> Inverse neural net  takes the target performance and predicts the design parameters. In this paper instead of standard MSE, they use R^2 score based loss function - i.e. the loss function is calculated by passing the Inverse net output to the frozen forward net


This can be improvised to use a physics-constrained forward model and Jacobian integrated Inverse Network to adapt it to our project to find the design parameters along with considering the yield.
