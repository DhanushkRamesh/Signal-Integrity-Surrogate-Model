This paper talks about the instability in the pcb fabrication cause the characteristic impedance to deviate from design specs. These mismatched leads to degradation of the signal integrity ;ile signal reflection, overshoot, and undershoo.

In the research they find that the manufacturing batches are statistically distinct from each other with 95% confidence. 

It is evident from this paper that there is a tolerance of +-10% in trace width. Material properties - Dielectric constant can vary. Sometimes geometric non-ideality.
