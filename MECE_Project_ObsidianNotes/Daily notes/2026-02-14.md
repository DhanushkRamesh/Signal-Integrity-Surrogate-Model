did not record progress - was fully occupied in openEMS solving the errors. Did a simple sim though.

Btw received the dataset from SI/PI Database. Need to analyze it tomorrow. 

Today Prepare the presentation draft and the transcript of what to speak.

Need to structure the summaries

Need to draft a transcript for the peer review presentation.:

### **Title:** Physics-Constrained Inverse Design of 112G Vias

### **Slide 1: The Hook 

**(Time: 0:00 - 0:50)**

[To add a clean eye diagram and a failed eye diagram on both sides with a PCB drill in the middle depicting a slight tolerance will have a failure in yield. (one of the main focus of our project)]

**Script:** "Imagine designing a Formula 1 car that breaks if the wind changes by just 1 mile per hour. That is exactly what is happening in high-speed circuit design today.

We are currently moving to **112 Gigabits per second** data rates. At these speeds, the electrical signals are so sensitive that a microscopic manufacturing error—like a drill bit going 10% too deep—can completely destroy the signal integrity of a printed circuit board.

The challenge is, even though the current state-of-the-art AI model for signal integrity are highly accurate, most of them remain "Fragile" when it comes to real-world manufacturing.

Most of the existing models focus on accuracy - that is finding a single, optimal design point. However, in the high speed 112G domain, the design that works perfectly in computer simulation often fails because the design space is so tight on the factory floor because the model doesn't account for tolerances. Furthermore, most of the AI models enforce physics (like causality) through complex penalty functions which are computationally heavy. 

My project challenges this by asking: _Can we build an AI that doesn't just design for 'Performance', but designs for 'Manufacturability' and 'Physics'?_"

### **Slide 2: The Proposed Solution (The Yield-Tandem VAE)**

**(Time: 0:50 - 2:15)**

**[Visual Suggestion: Your "Yield-Tandem VAE" Architecture Diagram. Highlight 3 blocks: The VAE (Generator), The Rational Layer (Physics), and the Jacobian Loss (Robustness).]**

**Script:** "I propose a novel framework called the **Yield-Tandem VAE**. It moves beyond standard deep learning by integrating three specific innovations:

First, to solve the **'One-to-Many' problem**—where multiple geometries can produce the same signal—I use a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE)**. Unlike standard regression models that output a single 'average' design, my VAE generates a _distribution_ of valid geometric options for engineers to choose from.

Second, to enforce **Physics**, I am replacing the standard 'Black Box' forward model with a **Differentiable Rational Layer**. Instead of predicting raw data points, my network predicts **Poles and Residues**. This mathematically guarantees that every generated design obeys **Kramers-Kronig Causality**, preventing the AI from hallucinating non-physical results.

Third, and most importantly, I am introducing a **Jacobian Yield Loss**. Inspired by recent work in **Scientific Machine Learning (Janvier et al., 2026)**, I use a Finite-Difference approximation of the Jacobian matrix during training. This penalizes designs that are 'sharp peaks'—where a small change leads to failure—and forces the AI to find 'flat plateaus' that remain stable even with manufacturing errors."

### **Slide 3: Why It Matters (The Impact)**

**(Time: 2:15 - 3:00)**

**[Visual Suggestion: A bar chart comparing "Standard AI Yield (50%)" vs. "Ours (90%)". A bullet point list: "1. Guaranteed Causality. 2. Factory-Ready Designs. 3. 1000x Speedup."]**

**Script:** "Why does this matter? Because in the hardware industry, **Yield is King.**

A design that works in simulation but fails in the factory costs millions of dollars in re-spins and wasted materials. Standard 'Inverse Design' papers ignore this. My work bridges the gap between **Academic AI** and **Industrial Reality**.

By enforcing causality, we build trust—engineers know the AI isn't violating physics. By optimizing for the Jacobian, we guarantee that the designs are robust enough to actually be built.

Ultimately, this moves us from using AI as a simple calculator to using AI as a **reliable, physics-aware co-designer** that can accelerate 112G development from weeks of simulation to milliseconds of inference.
