[[Core Idea - Physics-Constrained Generative Inverse Design of 112G Vias for Manufacturing Yield]]
==**Brainstroming**==: Did research on how to adapt the hybrid model based on papers [[Literatures]]. Got a idea of why not adapt the model of Akinwade et al. and Konduru et al, as Kondurus 1D convolution works better and makes the workload less?

Also the data generation to be adapted with Konduru et al. They use sobol sequences to ensure high quality data. 

Plan is to use Akinwade's complex weights with Konduru's transposed convolution to refere the neighbourng curve as well? Akinwade's model is deterministic. 

This will add novel value to the project? need to confirm with Dr. Marissa

==**Simulation/ Coding**==: Tried to code the simulation if it can be exeuted in python, got a few errors but working on the math to troubleshoot it and make it accurate to simulate. Explored the libraries that can be used to create the simulation environment. (not a total failure but will see some progress tomorrow?)

Could'nt do much other than this today - will continue tomorrow - mainly focusing on suimulation and exploration for datasets. 

**to do** - need to still learn the math behind the forward model of Akinwade - still need to fully decode the model and methods used and if it will be accurate in python.
