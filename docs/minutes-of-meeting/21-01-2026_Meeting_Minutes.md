**project meeting minutes**

 **Date:** 21-01-2026

 **Location:** Stokes Builing, DCU.

 **Attendees:** Dhanush Kumar Ramesh (Student), Dr. Marissa Condon(Supervisor)
 
## 1. Agenda
 * Review the initial project proposal (surrogate model for signal integrity.)
 * Feedback on proposed approach for the surrogate model.
 * Establishment of the project repository and initial tasks.
 
## 2 Key Discussion Points                                                                               

 ### Topic A: Technical Approach
 * Study the scientific approach of Complex Valued Neural Networl detailed in paper "Surrogate Modeling With Complex-Valued Neural
Nets for Signal Integrity Applications" and study the math behind it.
 * Need to investigate if any open-source datasets available that can be used for training and also methods to generate datasets.
 * Explore if the forward model could be implemented in python and also if the simulations can be done in
 python.
 
 ### Topic B: Future Directions
 * Defining appropriate objective functions for the inverse model.
 * Inverse model should also be implemented in python.
 * Exploration of novel aspects that could be added to the project.
 
 ### Topic C: Repository Setup
 * Create a Repository in GitHub to track and document the progress.

## 3. Decisions Made
 * The Proposal to use forward and inverse model is accepted considering the proper approach is studied f
rom the paper and modified to our project need.
 * Implementation in python to be explored and results to be discussed in next meeting.
 Priority to find open-source datasets. If not, simulate the data (explore if can be simulated in python.)
