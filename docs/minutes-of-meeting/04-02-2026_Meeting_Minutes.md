**project meeting minutes**

 **Date:** 04-02-2026

 **Location:** Stokes Builing, DCU.

 **Attendees:** Dhanush Kumar Ramesh (Student), Dr. Marissa Condon(Supervisor)
 
## 1. Agenda
 * Discuss the forward model approach
 * Usage of Dataset and openEMS exploration
 * Novel aspect majorly focusing on Inverse Model
 
## 2 Key Discussion Points                                                                               

 ### Topic A: Technical Approach
 * Focus majorly on inverse model as the forward models are already established. Add Novel aspects and find ways to make the inverse model better
 * Agreed upon the usage of tuhh si/pi database for training the model and also to use it with random variations. Also to explore the use of openEMS.
 * Research and work on finding the methods and logic (that add novel aspect) to the inverse model.
 
 ### Topic B: Future Directions
 * Defining appropriate objective functions for the inverse model.
 * Analyzing openEMS and to provide initial results as soon as results are generated (will be discussed in detail in next meeting)
 * Exploration of novel aspects that could be added to the project.


## 3. Decisions Made
 * To focus on Inverse model and find what methods can be used.
 * Explore openEMS and analyze the data from SI/PI database from TUHH.
