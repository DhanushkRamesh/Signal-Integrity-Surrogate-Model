Explored some papers and methods for inverse problem. Got a few Idea to use Jacobian regularization for tandem network and also some novel aspects to add it

Also collected information on INN - best for solving inverse problem 

Diffusion models were explored but it is very difficult to implement? we dont have enough data? haven't received the dataset yet
