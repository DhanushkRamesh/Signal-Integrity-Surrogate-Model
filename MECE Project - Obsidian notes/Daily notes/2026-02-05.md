Exploring what methods to use in inverse model - to make it novel - and what objective functions can be added?

Got a few papers but not sure how it'll help

The papers were useful and the latest sota are diffusion models and Invertible Neural Nets but gonna be complicated? 

need to explore more to check if they can be completed within the timeline and also consider using tandem network, just in case - Tandem network can be useful application as well from the papers referred.
